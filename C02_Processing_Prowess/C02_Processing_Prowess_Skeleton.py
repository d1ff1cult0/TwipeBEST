### OBJECTIVE
"""
Write a function which receives an integer n and returns the integer that the bits of n reversed
produce.

For example, 20 in binary is 10100. The output should be 5 since its binary representation is 00101.
"""

### INPUT - DO NOT TOUCH
n = int(input())

### EXAMPLE INPUT - YOU MAY COPY THIS INTO THE TERMINAL TO TEST YOUR CODE
### 20

### EXAMPLE OUTPUT - YOU MAY UNCOMMENT THIS LINE TO CHECK THE EXAMPLE INPUT
### assert bit_reverser(n) == 5
