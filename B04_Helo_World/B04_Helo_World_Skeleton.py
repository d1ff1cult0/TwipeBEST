### You have found an old English text from the year 2022. You can’t quite read the message but you do know that old English from that time is pretty similar to present day English. The only changes are that we have abolished the use of the letter ‘c’ and replaced it with a ‘k’. We also don’t use any consonant twice in a row anymore. (consonants are all the letters that apart from ‘a’,’e’,’i’,’o’,’u’). We also don’t put an ‘e’ at the end of words anymore. Please translate the given text.
